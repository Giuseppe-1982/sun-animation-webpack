# Solar Cycle Animation (Webpack Version)

An interactive web animation that simulates a dynamic solar cycle featuring the sun, moon, moving clouds, and shooting stars.  
Built with HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and powered by Webpack.

## Features

- **Day/Night Cycle**: Smooth animation of the sun and moon transitioning through the solar cycle.
- **Dynamic Clouds**: Clouds drift naturally across the sky with subtle animations.
- **Shooting Stars**: Animated shooting stars appear randomly for a lively night sky.
- **Particle Effects**: Starry night effect implemented using [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js).
- **Background Music**: Relaxing music plays automatically; click anywhere to pause/resume both animations and audio.
- **Interactive Pause**: Single click pauses all animations and background music; click again to resume.
