// *******************************************************
// Styles for the Cloud Effects in the Sky
// *******************************************************
//
// This block contains the styles for the clouds in the sky,
// including the container and individual cloud elements that 
// create the dynamic movement effect. Different clouds are 
// animated with varying speeds and positions to simulate 
// realistic sky behavior.
//
// Key Features:
// - Animates cloud movement with different speeds (drift).
// - Defines the cloud container to cover the entire viewport.
// - Each cloud variation has unique animation and size settings.
//
// The animation of the clouds helps create a dynamic background
// simulating the drifting of clouds across the sky.
